Originally there were 5 text files copypasted from wikipedia and the program encrypts them into a single encrypted file.

The program could use 5 integer keysetting to encrypt/obfuscate the file, and outputs and encrypted file.

The counterpart decryption program can decrypt the encrypted file back into the original source text files.
